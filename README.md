Developing Data Products
=========================

### Objective

Create a Shiny Application that will allow users to interact with the Motor Trend Car Road Tests. The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and ten aspects
of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“1974 models). The application runs a simply linear regression model on the variable(s) that the user selects (multiple selection is allowed). 
The outcome is miles per gallon (MPG). The gauge box reports back the adjusted R-square value for the model. The R-square value is used as a marker of good fit between the model and the data and can run from
0 to 100 (%). Adjusted R-square penalizes the model for the number of independent variable used to model, hence providing a more conservative fitness value. The Validity status box reports whether the model
had a p-value < 0.05 and significance status. Significance status are: VOID, VALID, and NULL. NULL occurs when there is an error in the data or lack of data and the model is not created.

## Instructions

1. Select the independent variables you believe are associated with MPG
2. Review the results in the GAUGE box and STATUS box.
3. If you feel that the order of the boxes is confusing, move them! They are designed to be moved around as needed for idea flow.
4. If you need to restart, just hit refresh and the boxes will return to their starting locations.
5. Get thinkin'!
